# Weather Dashboard Project

Welcome to the **Weather Practice Project**, a project I am creating while at work for the [**MMC Digital Lab**](https://mmcdigitallab.com).

## üìñ Overview

This project uses the [**Geoapify API**](https://www.geoapify.com) to geocode user inputs and provide autocomplete suggestions. It also uses the [**National Weather Service (NWS) API**](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to retrieve and display weather data. Users can easily input a location and view weather details presented in charts and visualizations.


## üåê Live Dashboards

- **[Main Dashboard](https://mmcweather.streamlit.app)**: The Main Dashboard is designed for comprehensive weather data analysis. It has the most capabilities.
  
- **[Sample Dashboard](https://mmcweathersample.streamlit.app)**: The Sample Dashboard provides a simple and straightforward example of a Streamlit application. It was developed at the early stages of the project to illustrate the core concept and functionality of the weather dashboard.
