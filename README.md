# Weather Dashboard Project

Welcome to the **Weather Practice Project**, a project I am creating while at work for the [MMC Digital Lab](https://mmcdigitallab.com).

## 🌐 Live Dashboards

- **[Main Dashboard](https://mmcweather.streamlit.app)**: The Main Dashboard is designed for comprehensive weather data analysis. It has the most capabilities.
  
- **[Sample Dashboard](https://mmcweathersample.streamlit.app)**: The Sample Dashboard provides a simple and straightforward example of a Streamlit application. It was developed at the early stages of the project to illustrate the core concept and functionality of the weather dashboard.

## 📖 Overview

This project leverages the **National Weather Service (NWS) API** to retrieve and display weather data. Users can easily input a location and view weather details presented in interactive charts and visualizations.
